# Welcome to Mixed Messages!    
I have written two programs here, in JavaScript.    
  * Children's Story Prompt Generator  
  * Surly Fortune Teller  

The first is The Childrens Story Prompt Generator, inspired by Will Ferrel's comedy. It is designed to assist with the beginning of stories, for when you need to be quick on your feet when a child asks for one. It gives you the main characters, setting, and situation, but it has plenty of fun for the adults too.    

    
The second one is the Surly Fortune Teller. This one is hangry, and designed to give you a sassy fortune reading.   
  
        
    ### Keep running the program to get different answers each time! Have fun!
